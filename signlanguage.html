    <h2 class="heading _2xl">Sign Language</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Sign language is a natural language for Deaf and Hard of hearing individuals and it possesses the linguistic properties just as a spoken language. It is not made from the spoken language because it has its own grammar and syntax. It is also not a universal language, there are different sign languages in different countries. In Sign language: An International Handbook (2021), the authors state that it is a visual spatial language which relies on the use of facial expressions, hand gestures, and body positions to convey the thought, meaning, and concepts. It has limited signing space in front of the top half of the body and around the head. Facial expressions are very important to give emphasis to language. Handshape, palm orientation, movement, and location are the four aspects of the parameters. It is good accessibility to understand easily from the visuals rather than the texts. Sign language has its limited words and its own grammatical structures, and syntax. It does not use “state of being” verbs (am, is, are, was, were) and articles (a, an, the). It uses the verb, which represents an action, an event or a state of being about the subject.
    <br>For instance,
      </p>
        <p class="paragraphyquote3">
        Spoken: “I would like a small cup of tea, please.
        <br>
          <div class="gallery-image-wrapper w-node-c72d006c-e1c9-6766-ce92-17cbef402f79-52299390" style="will-change: opacity; opacity: 1;">
          <img src="img/img_ASL.png"></div>
          <p class="paragraphyquote3">ASL: “tea/ small/ cup/ have/ please."</p>
        </p>
      
      
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">On the other hand, In the United States, there are three forms of sign language namely
American Sign Language (ASL), Pidgin Signed English (PSE), and Signing Exact English
(SEE). Pidgin Signed English (PSE) is a merged version of Sign language and English, which
uses signs for exact English words, and exact English order. It is the most used sign language
among Deaf and hearing individuals who work together. PSE is simpler to use than sign
language and SEE as it does not include English word endings and ASL structure. Signing Exact
English (SEE) is a sign language which uses the exact English language words, anyhow it is
expanded with words, prefixes, tenses and endings. PSE and SEE are good benefit for Deaf
individuals who develop their language, even so all of three sign languages have their own times,
such as:</p>
      <p class="paragraphyquote3">
        <q><b>Spoken:</b> “I am going upstairs to get my laptop.”- 1 seconds
        <br><b>ASL:</b> “Me / upstairs / get / my / laptop.” - 1.8 seconds
          <br><b>PSE:</b> “I / go / upstairs / to / get / my / laptop.” - 2.8 seconds
          <br><b>SEE:</b> “I / am / going / upstairs / to / get / my laptop.” - 4.8 seconds</q></p>
      
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">There are many visuals in sign language for a variety of careers. Often we have to spell
new vocabulary as there is no sign for it so we do not have any sign language for new
vocabulary. It would be a good multimedia solution - a sign language website using ASL core
that is produced to translate all of the content into sign language so they have full and
synchronized information for Deaf users as well as everyone. It could have benefits for different
careers like computer science, fashion design, medical information, etc, however there is a
problem that it takes a lot of time to make these videos. It’s easy to make one piece of
information, but not to make the whole video.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">DeafSpace is important and useful for the Deaf individual and sign language interpreter
as sign language is a visual gestural language. It has a strong effect on proxemics and kinesics
because it is indispensable for the study of body movement, touching, eye contact and facial
expression. Eye contact and the visibility of signs are important aspects of having a conversation.Choosing a good place allows the Deaf individual and the interpreter to set up the seat with the
best visual vantage point.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">For the news or important events, the video of the live sign language interpreter is well
positioned on the right hand side, alternatively the sign language interpreter is standing near the
speaker in the live video recording. Deaf hosts can make and deliver the top news and deaf topics
using American sign language in videos on their social media platforms or their websites like
The Daily Moth or ISH news for deaf audiences, but the process of researching, recording, and
uploading a video is long. However, this position of video is different from having a Zoom or
video conversation, it is designated to have multiple participants so Deaf individuals can set up
as pins of sign language channel interpreters, it gives a better solution to providing closed
captioning. In debates or discussions, there are many speakers and moderators so it is possibly
attainable to request multiple interpreters, which helps recognize who is speaking. The classes
and workshops are challenging for making eye movements and speed reading of speakers, sign
language interpreters, classmates, and presentation at the same time, nevertheless they depend on
the Deaf individuals' vision, so the physical aspects become important. Sign language
interpreters use Deaf individuals’ line of sight, and ask them about where they should be and
maintain eye contact when there is a clear view of both the speaker and the interpreter.
    </p>
    <br>  
    <p class="paragraph">Sign languages are not recognized in various countries; very few countries recognize and
accept sign languages. It is argued that there may be a lack of vocabulary or grammar during the
careers because there is no updated information about Deaf individuals, how a sign language
affects or does not affect Deaf children’s ability to develop their written and spoken language of
their community. Professional sign language interpreters are not extensively provided all over the
world except in the United States. Also, the video relay services are limited. Currently, Deaf
users have to use separate phone numbers for the cellular phone and video relay service
application or captioning services while the hearing users call and text using their same phone
number.</p>
